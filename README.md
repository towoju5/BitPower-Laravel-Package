Authentication
Authentication is handled using your public/secret key token or API key included in the Authorization header of each request. Please create an account or contact bitpowr support to get your keys.

ðŸ“˜ All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail. The Authorization header must be sent for every request unless stated otherwise. Not doing so will result in an unauthorized response.

Using Public and Secret Key
This uses the public and secret keys of your account to gain access to your account using the API. To use this, you would need to concat them in this format {public_key:secret_key} and encode it to base64 encoding before passing it to the header. This method gives you admin access to your account and won't be able to restrict keys

Authorization: Bearer <ENCODED_TOKEN>

Mode/Network
The mode and network of the account basically depend on the keys you are using to authorize. To connect to the mainnet environment, ensure your keys are for LIVE mode and if you want to test use the TEST keys. In Production, ensure you are using the LIVE keys which make your account interact with the mainnet Network.

Rate Limiting
If too many requests are received using the same access token, that access token will be throttled. Throttled requests will receive a response with a status code of 429 and will contain a Retry-After header that indicates how many seconds the user should wait before making additional requests. Please design your client to adhere to the Retry-After header, and not the current rate limit.

Supported Blockchains
We currently support 11 public blockchains to be used right from your API and dashboard. We are continuously adding new blockchains every day.
